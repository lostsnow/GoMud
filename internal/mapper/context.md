## Usage Patterns

### Basic Map Generation
```go

config := MapConfig{
    Width:       21,
    Height:      15,
    ShowSecrets: false,
    ShowLocked:  true,
    CenterRoom:  playerRoomId,
}

mapLines, err := mapper.GenerateMap(userId, centerRoomId, config)
if err != nil {
    // Handle mapping error
}

// Display map to user
for _, line := range mapLines {
    sendToUser(line)
}
```

### Pathfinding Usage
```go
// Find path to specific destination
pathResult := mapper.FindPath(startRoom, destinationRoom, userId)
if pathResult.Found {
    directions := mapper.GetDirections(pathResult.Path)
    for _, direction := range directions {
        sendToUser(direction)
    }
} else {
    sendToUser("No path found to destination")
}
```

### Navigation Assistance
```go
// Find nearest shop
shopResult := mapper.FindNearestRoom(playerRoom, "shop", userId)
if shopResult.Found {
    directions := mapper.GetDirections(shopResult.Path)
    sendToUser(fmt.Sprintf("Nearest shop is %d rooms away:", shopResult.Distance))

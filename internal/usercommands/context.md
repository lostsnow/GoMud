# User Commands Package Context

## Overview
The `internal/usercommands` package implements the complete command system for player interactions in GoMud. It defines all player-executable commands, from basic movement and communication to complex skills, combat actions, and administrative functions.

## Key Components

### Command Architecture (`usercommands.go`)
- **UserCommand function signature**: Standardized interface for all commands
  ```go
  type UserCommand func(rest string, user *users.UserRecord, room *rooms.Room, flags events.EventFlag) (bool, error)
  ```
- **CommandAccess structure**: Defines command permissions and restrictions
- **Command registry**: Central mapping of command names to implementations
- **Permission system**: Admin-only commands and downed-state restrictions

### Command Categories

#### **Basic Interaction Commands**
- **Movement**: `go`, `flee` - Navigation and escape mechanics

### Command Processing Features

#### **Input Parsing and Validation**
- **Argument parsing**: Sophisticated parsing with quote respect for complex arguments
- **Target resolution**: Finding players, mobs, and objects by name or partial match
- **State validation**: Checking combat status, buffs, and other restrictions

#### **Permission and Security**
- **Role-based access**: Admin commands restricted by user permissions
- **State restrictions**: Commands blocked when downed, in combat, or affected by buffs
- **Cooldown management**: Time-based restrictions on command usage

#### **Event Integration**
- **Event flags**: Commands can be executed secretly or with special modifiers
- **Event emission**: Commands trigger events for logging and system integration
- **Combat integration**: Commands interact with combat state and aggro systems

### Skill Integration

#### **Skill-Based Commands** (`skill.*.go` files)
- **Cast system**: Magic spell casting with proficiency scaling
- **Brawling skills**: Physical combat techniques (disarm, tackle, throw)
- **Utility skills**: Map creation, portal magic, inspection abilities
- **Protection skills**: Aid and defensive capabilities

#### **Skill Validation**
- **Level requirements**: Commands check character skill levels
- **Proficiency effects**: Higher skill levels improve command effectiveness
- **Training integration**: Skills can be improved through use and training

### Administrative System

#### **World Management**
- **Room editing**: Comprehensive room modification capabilities
- **Zone management**: Creating and managing game world zones
- **Spawn control**: Managing mob and item spawning

#### **Player Administration**
- **Character modification**: Changing player stats, levels, and properties
- **Punishment system**: Muting, deafening, and other disciplinary actions
- **Server monitoring**: System status and performance monitoring

### Special Features

#### **Command Suggestions**
- **Fuzzy matching**: Suggesting similar commands for typos
- **Context-aware help**: Relevant command suggestions based on situation
- **Admin filtering**: Different suggestions for admin vs regular users

#### **Scripting Integration**
- **JavaScript exposure**: Commands can be called from game scripts
- **Function export**: Command functions available to scripting system
- **Event-driven execution**: Commands can be triggered by game events

#### **Alias System**
- **Custom shortcuts**: Players can create command aliases
- **Macro support**: Complex command sequences through aliases

## Dependencies
- `internal/users`: User management and character data
- `internal/rooms`: Room system for location-based commands
- `internal/events`: Event system for command effects and logging
- `internal/mobs`: NPC interaction and combat
- `internal/items`: Item manipulation and inventory management
- `internal/skills`: Skill system integration
- `internal/spells`: Magic system integration
- `internal/buffs`: Status effect checking and application
- `internal/scripting`: JavaScript runtime integration

## Usage Patterns
- Commands follow consistent signature and return conventions
- State validation occurs before command execution
- Events are emitted for logging and system integration
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized access
- Error handling provides user feedback and system logging

## Testing
The package includes comprehensive testing for:
- Command parsing and argument handling
- Permission and access control
- State validation and restrictions
- Integration with other game systems
- Administrative functionality

## Architecture Benefits
- **Modular design**: Each command is self-contained and focused
- **Consistent interface**: All commands follow the same signature pattern
- **Extensible system**: New commands can be easily added to the registry
- **Permission control**: Granular access control for different user types
- **Event integration**: Commands seamlessly integrate with the game's event system

This package serves as the primary interface between players and the game world, providing a rich and comprehensive command system that supports all aspects of gameplay from basic interaction to advanced administrative functions.

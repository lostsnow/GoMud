# Suggestions System Context

## Overview

The `internal/suggestions` package provides a simple suggestion cycling system for the GoMud game engine. It manages a list of suggestions that users can cycle through, commonly used for command completion, auto-suggestions, or help hints in interactive interfaces.

## Key Components

### Core Files
- **suggestions.go**: Complete suggestion management and cycling functionality

### Key Structures

#### Suggestions
```go
type Suggestions struct {
    suggestions []string
    pos         int
}
```
Manages a list of suggestions with cycling functionality:
- **suggestions**: Array of suggestion strings
- **pos**: Current position in the suggestion list for cycling

## Core Methods

### List Management
- **Set(suggestions []string)**: Sets the suggestion list and resets position
  - Replaces current suggestions with new list
  - Resets position to beginning of list
  - Used for updating suggestions based on context

- **Clear()**: Empties the suggestion list and resets position
  - Removes all suggestions
  - Resets position to 0
  - Used for clearing context-specific suggestions

- **Count() int**: Returns the number of available suggestions
  - Provides count for UI display or validation
  - Used for checking if suggestions are available

### Suggestion Cycling
- **Next() string**: Returns the next suggestion in the cycle
  - Advances position and returns current suggestion
  - Wraps around to beginning when reaching end of list
  - Returns empty string if no suggestions available
  - Implements circular cycling behavior

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Suggestion Management
```go
// Create and populate suggestions
suggestions := &Suggestions{}
suggestions.Set([]string{"help", "look", "inventory", "quit"})

// Cycle through suggestions
firstSuggestion := suggestions.Next()  // "help"
secondSuggestion := suggestions.Next() // "look"
// ... continues cycling through list

// Check available count
if suggestions.Count() > 0 {
    // Suggestions available
}

// Clear suggestions
suggestions.Clear()
```

### Interactive Command Completion
```go
// Set context-specific suggestions
if userInput == "h" {
    suggestions.Set([]string{"help", "history", "home"})
} else if userInput == "l" {
    suggestions.Set([]string{"look", "list", "lock"})
}

// User cycles through with tab key
nextCompletion := suggestions.Next()
```

## Integration Points

### Command System
- **Command Completion**: Provides auto-completion for user commands
- **Alias Suggestions**: Suggests command aliases and shortcuts
- **Parameter Hints**: Suggests valid parameters for commands
- **Context Awareness**: Different suggestions based on current context

### User Interface
- **Tab Completion**: Integration with tab-based completion systems
- **Help Systems**: Suggests relevant help topics
- **Interactive Prompts**: Provides options during interactive sessions
- **Error Recovery**: Suggests corrections for invalid input

### Input Processing
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Suggests similar commands for typos
- **History Integration**: Suggests from command history
- **Smart Completion**: Context-aware suggestion generation
- **Progressive Filtering**: Narrows suggestions as user types

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Lightweight Structure**: Minimal memory overhead per suggestion set
- **String Reuse**: Reuses string references without duplication
- **Efficient Cycling**: O(1) position tracking and cycling
- **Minimal Allocation**: No additional allocations during cycling

### Access Performance
- **Fast Cycling**: Direct array access for O(1) suggestion retrieval
- **Efficient Updates**: Fast list replacement and position reset
- **Low Latency**: Minimal processing overhead for interactive use
- **Responsive UI**: Fast enough for real-time user interaction

## Design Patterns

### Circular Buffer Behavior
- **Wrap-Around**: Automatically cycles back to beginning
- **Continuous Cycling**: Users can cycle indefinitely through suggestions
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent cycling pattern for user familiarity
- **State Preservation**: Position maintained between calls

### Stateful Iterator
- **Position Tracking**: Maintains current position in suggestion list
- **State Reset**: Position resets when list changes
- **Deterministic**: Predictable iteration order and behavior
- **Simple Interface**: Minimal API for ease of use

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Bidirectional Cycling**: Support for previous/next navigation
- **Weighted Suggestions**: Priority-based suggestion ordering
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Approximate string matching for suggestions
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time filtering based on partial input

### Integration Improvements
- **History Integration**: Learn from user command history
- **Contextual Awareness**: More sophisticated context detection
- **Personalization**: User-specific suggestion preferences
- **Machine Learning**: Adaptive suggestions based on usage patterns

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used suggestion sets
- **Lazy Loading**: Load suggestions on demand
- **Compression**: Compress large suggestion datasets
- **Batch Updates**: Efficient batch suggestion updates

### User Experience
- **Visual Indicators**: Show current position in suggestion list
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enhanced keyboard navigation
- **Mouse Support**: Click-to-select suggestion functionality
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and accessibility support

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- **Suggestion Sanitization**: Ensure suggestions don't contain harmful content
- **Length Limits**: Prevent excessively long suggestion lists
- **Content Filtering**: Filter inappropriate or dangerous suggestions
- **Injection Prevention**: Prevent code injection through suggestions

### Resource Management
- **Memory Limits**: Prevent excessive memory usage from large suggestion sets
- **CPU Protection**: Limit processing time for suggestion generation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of suggestion cycling
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of suggestion resources

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **Empty Lists**: Handle empty suggestion lists gracefully
- **Invalid State**: Recover from invalid position states
- **Null Safety**: Safe handling of nil or empty suggestions
- **Boundary Conditions**: Proper handling of edge cases

### Robustness
- **State Validation**: Validate internal state consistency
- **Error Recovery**: Recover from corrupted suggestion state
- **Defensive Programming**: Handle unexpected input gracefully
- **Logging**: Log errors for debugging and monitoring
